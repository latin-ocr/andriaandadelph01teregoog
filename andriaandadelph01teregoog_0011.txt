the numbering, will not, it is believed, detract at all from
their value or interest to the student,

The principal object in the Notes has been to aid the ’
pupil in understanding the forms, meanings‚ and con-
structione of words peculiar to Terence or to his age, and
the numerous elliptical colloquial expressions that occur,

as well as to explain the plot of each play. In their
preparation, use has been made chiefly of the commen· “
taries of Wilhelm Wagner, Cambridge, Eng, 1869, Ε.
St. J. Parry in the Bibliotheca Classica, London, 1857,
Reinhold Klotz (The Andria), Leipsic‚ 1865, J. A. Phil-
lips,Dublin,1846‚an‹1 occasionally of the older worlrs „
of Klotz (1838), Stallbaum, and Westerhovius, which
also contain the commentaries of the ancient gram·
mariana ·Donatus and Eugraphius

A brief account of Terence and his writings has been
prefixed to the Notes, and an Appendix added upon the
prosody and matres, with the metrical key to the Andria

and Adclphoc.
No American edition of Terence has been published

since that of Dillaway in 1839. It is therefore hoped, ' ¹

with the more confidence, that this edition may be of '
service to the pupil in his study of the language in the
earlier period of its history, and may contributa to the
better appreciation of an author who, in purity of idiom
and elegance of style, was not surpassed by Cicero or
Caesar, and whose plays are among the finest specimens
of Roman comedy extant*
