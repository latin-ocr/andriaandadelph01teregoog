OCORDING tb the eminent critic, Fr. Ritschl‚ all

the more ancient Mffl. of Terence, except one, bear
the subscription of Calliopius, and are none of them
earlier than the ninth century. That one, now in the
Vatican Library, by far the oldest and best, though tho
first 785 lines of the Andria are lost, belongs to the fifth
century, was once in the possession 01 the cardinal Pietro
Bembo of Venice, and is called the Bembine. Of a col-
lation of this MS. by Petrus Victorius, now in the Royal
Librsry at Munich, Fleckeisen availed himself in the
preparation 01 110 text published in the Teubner series
' of classice in 1857 ; and this textis adopted in the present
edition 01 the Andria and Adclpltoe. With it, however,
has been carefrrlly compared the edition of Francis
Umpfenbach, Berlin, 1870, which contains exact colla-
tions 01 011 the important MSS, and furnishes the most
complete critical apparatus which has yet appeared.
'The more important various readings are mentioned in
the Notes, and in ¹a very few instances only a different
reading has been preferred to that of Fleckeisen.
The comedies 01 Terence, in comparison with those 01
Plautus, stand in very little need 01 expurgation; and
