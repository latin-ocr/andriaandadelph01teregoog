betrothed him to Philumena, another daughter oi Chremes. His
iather's first suspicion oi Pamphilus’ opposition to this was awakened
by observing his conduct at Chrysis'funera13 while Chremes, on learn-
ing the whole story os Pamphilus' connection with her, broke or the
match.

The aetion oi the play begins at this point. Simo announoes to

Pamphilus that he must marry Philumena at once, hoping that ir he
consents Chremes may be reconciled. This brings Pamphilus into
great perplexity. But Davus, finding on investigation that the mer-
rioge is a pretence, advises Pamphilus to humor his father by profess-
ing to consent, and te keep up the suspicions of Chremes by his
intimacy with Glycerium. Meanwhile, Charinus, afriend oi Pamphilus
and lover of Philumena, has heard of his proposed marriage to her,
and urges him to defer it, if possible.
' Just at this time, Simo, again negotiating with Chremes, secures his
assent, and Charinus is now angry at the supposed treachery of Pam-
philus, while Davus is reproached by his mester for his untoward
advice. As a last resort, he brings about an interview between Chremes
and Mysis, whose story ot Glycerium end her child occasions again a
rupture between him and Simo. At this juncture, Crito, a citizen of
Andros and next oi kin to Chrysis, arrives, who clears up the history
of Glycerium. She ie recognized as Chremes' daughter, and his eon·
sent, with that ot Simo, Pamphilus then obtains tor their marriage.

The Asrdrs'cnue oi Michel Baron the French dramatist, and the
Conectens hovers ol' Steele, are close imitatione of this play.

DIDASCALIA.

The now current text oi the dirimendae, or ts'euls', prefixed to the
plays oi Terence is due to the Enreudulioncr of Ant. Goveanus (Venice,
1567). In it various readings, both oi the Bembina and the Callio-
pian text, are mixed up. Both are again founded on a more original
and complete collection os notices, which seem to have been put together
from stage-copies by grammaticus os the seventh cent. u. c., who also,
without doubt, availed themselves oi the cucumerarii magistratusue, in
which an accurate account was kept os all exhibitione made by the
magistrates on the great annual festivals. T. The work oi Varro, Dc
actionibus scenicis libri (not now extant), was based on these critical
labora of the grammarians, and is the real source oi the didascalice in
their present form. That of the Andria is wanting in the aestues,
but has been preserved by Donatus in his preiaoe to the play. Wr.
