not only to minor differenees ol name and incident, but to a new eon-
eeption in some instances os the plote of his plays and the characters
he was reprodneing. Availing himself ol the whole cf the Menandrian
repertory‚ he worked up the old materiei· into a new and consistent
creation. The number of fragments of unescerteined plays ol Me-
nander which fit more or less closely with Terence, many of them
quite ns well as those passages direetly quoted from the corresponding
plays of Menander, leads us ιο the conclusion that Terence drew not
only l'rom the single play which he hed before him, but aleo frum his
general knowledge of the werke of Menander and the other authore
ot* Greek eomedy.”

His excellence in the delineation of character has also been generally
admitted. Varro's judgment was: In etherio Perellius poerit palmare.
“A close etudy‚” says Parry‚ “will verify that both in the grouping
and the treatment of his characters, 'l’erence is an originales eom-
pared with Plautus; and from the hints we ean glean from the seattered
fragments ol the Greek eomediaus, we may conclude that he was iu a
great measure original, even when compared with Menander.'' And
Mommsen remarks that “while Plautus paints his characters with broad
strokes, often after a stoek model, Terence handles the psychologiesl
development with a carelul and often excellent miniature painting.”

The complaint hae sometimes been mede that Terence was deficient
in comio soree, and thet he laeked the liveliness, freshness, and verse-
tility of Plautus. Mommsen's lenguuge is that ‘he reprodnced the
agreenbleness without the merriment of Menander) And in support
os this allegation the famous epigram os Caesar, preserved by Sue·
tonius, hasbeen often quoted:

Lenibus atque utinam scriptia adiuncta foret uie,
comica et aequato uirtus polleret honore

Οιιοι Gruees’s, oeque in leuc despectus parte iacerent
Vnum hcc nauceror et doleo ribi deesse, Terenti.

But it must always be remembered that Terenee's plays are ⁴ comedies
of sentiment,’ in which the ele comica hes a subordinate place, and the
distinguishing characteristica os which ere humor end pathos. In
these qualities he has been considered by scholare best qualified ιο pro-
nounce an opinion, net deficient by the side of Menander. The eon-
elusio'n of the writer in Smitb's Dictionery, ln his comparison of the
two eomedians, is: “ Granting tc Plautus the highest genius forexeiting
laughter, the eloquence Aelius Stilo ascribed to him, and a natural
force-eirtas-whieh Terence wanted, there will remain to the latter
