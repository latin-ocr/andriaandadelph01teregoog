INTRODUOTION.

Tua very little that la known of the lile of Pnsnrns Taenarius Assa
is obtained chiefly from an extract from the De Poetis oi Suetonius,
preserved by the grammarian Aelius Donatus (fl. A. D. 350) in the
introduction to his commentary on the eomedies oi this author.

Spaniards, aad Sardiniens, they were completing that circuit oi con-

Though the Greek langnage had been generally well known ior a
