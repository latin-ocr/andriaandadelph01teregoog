Ι well defy any critic to show where Terence left off and his friends
began.” The story can be explained by the fact of literary jealousy,
the hostility of the conservative faction in literature led hy Cato aud
the Fabii to every prominent writer in the opposite party, and, pcr-

, 1 haps, in part also, by the strong prejudices of the Romans against

freedrnen and foreigners, which even Horeoe experienoed. ln his
allusione to this accusation in the prologues of the Hoosoo siororomenoc

(l. 22-25), und of the Adelphos (l. 15-21), Terence does not indeed
deny it, in the former leaving the question of its truth to the judgrnent
of his hearers, and in the latter insisting that if it were true, he ought
to feel proud of it rather than ashamed; but his evasion of the charge
ean be accounted for ou the ground that it was impolitio for him to
deny that which would be so creditable, and therefore flattering‚ to his
patrone, while it would of course be readily admitted that he may have
read his plays to them, and have avalled himself of their criticisms.
The names of Terence's eomedies in the order in which they are
believed to have been written are: The Andria or Woman of Andros,
The Hecyra or Mother-in-law, The Eunuchos, The Hooton timoromc·
noe or half-Tormentor, The Phormio or Parasite, and the Adelphoe or
Brothers. It has been the fashion to charge him with being a copyist
in tha preparation of these plays, but this charge has been pressed too
closely. Even Mommsen admits that “ by the literal adherence of his
imitations to the originols we are not to understand a vorbal transla-
tion in our scnse.” For these productione he did not indeed claim
originality in tho striot sense of that term. In common with all the
playwrights of his day, it was simply his aim to reproduce in Latin
the beat worlrs of the Attio comedy, or rather to construet plays indo-
pendently out of the common Greek materiale. Four of them are
founded upon comediea of Menander, the most eminent cf the poets of
the N ew Comedy (whose worlrs are not now extant), and the other tuo
upon comedies of Apollodorus of Carystus in Euboea3 and his indobted-
nese to these writers is distinotly and fully aelrnowledged in his pro-
logues. He may, however, justly claim the merit of great art and some
inventive power in the skill with which he combined two or more
Greek plays into one, and in his treatment of his characters. The
practice of cootomirrotiop plays, es it was called, was a common one
with the early Roman poeta, and Terence formed the plots of four of
his plays in this way. But in this work he was no mere compilor.
Parry, who has carefully examined all the extant fragments of Me-
nander, expresses the opinion that Terence “ cannot simply have dove-
* tailed his new matter into the existing plot, bnt must, to a great extent,
heve recast the whole. The buosen variatione from the original extend
